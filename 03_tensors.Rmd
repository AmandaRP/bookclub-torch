# Tensors

**Learning objectives:**

- THESE ARE NICE TO HAVE BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

## What are tensors? {-}

```{r}
library(torch)
t1 <- torch_tensor(2)
summary(t1)
t1$dtype
t1$device
t1$shape
t2 <- t1$to(dtype = torch_int())
t2$dtype
t2 <- t1$to(device = "cuda")
t2$device
t3 <- t1$view(c(1,1))
t3$shape
```
